- [ ] color pallet inspector
- [ ] sprite pallet inspector
- [ ] profile container inspector
- [ ] maybe a list of all appliers in the root inspector?
- [ ] maybe inlining of the color or sprite for pallet references in profiles
- [ ] show warning in applier inspector for invalid profile names, or missing root
- [ ] maybe rect transform support, most likely particularly for being able to control left right top bottom "padding" when it is set to stretch, but should probably be just fully generic. Just
- [ ] use enumValueIndex where applicable
